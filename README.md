### Installing ROS Noetic and ROS2 Foxy on a MacBook with an i3 Processor

This report summarizes the steps I took to install and run ROS Noetic and ROS2 Foxy on my MacBook with an i3 processor, focusing on using the `turtlesim` package.

#### Tools and Requirements
- **Operating System**: macOS
- **Homebrew**: Package manager for macOS
- **Docker**: For running ROS Noetic
- **ROS Noetic** (via Docker)
- **ROS2 Foxy**

### Part 1: Installing ROS Noetic using Docker

1. **Install Homebrew**:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Docker**:
   ```bash
   brew install --cask docker
   ```

3. **Start Docker** and pull the ROS Noetic image:
   ```bash
   docker pull osrf/ros:noetic-desktop-full
   ```

4. **Run the ROS Noetic Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm osrf/ros:noetic-desktop-full
   ```

5. **Install and run `turtlesim` inside Docker**:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install ros-noetic-turtlesim
   roscore
   rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
   rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
   ```

### Part 2: Installing ROS2 Foxy

1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed)**:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   brew install python3 cmake tinyxml2 poco
   ```

3. **Install ROS2 Foxy**:
   ```bash
   brew tap ros2/ros2
   brew install ros-foxy-desktop
   ```

4. **Source the ROS2 Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
   ```

5. **Install and run `turtlesim`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlesim
   ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
   ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
   ```

### Conclusion
By following these steps, I successfully installed and used both ROS Noetic and ROS2 Foxy on my MacBook with an i3 processor. Using Docker for ROS Noetic and Homebrew for ROS2 Foxy allowed for a seamless setup, enabling me to control a virtual turtle using the `turtlesim` package.
